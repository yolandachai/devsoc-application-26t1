### Day and Night Vampire Dress-Up
Modelled after the flash dress-up games that were popular in the 2010s. Create two alternate outfits, inspired by what a vampire would wear in the daytime and nighttime!

Please note: Unfortunately, there is no save functionality yet, and there aren't as many outfits as I would have liked – I'll try to add more in the future! Further, the website is best viewed in windowed mode rather than fullscreen, and it does not support mobile or small window sizes. This is something that I am in the process of amending, and hopefully content that fits to the window will be supported soon!
