### Day and Night Vampire Dress-Up
Modelled after the flash dress-up games that were popular in the 2010s. Create two alternate outfits, inspired by what a vampire would wear in the daytime and nighttime!

Please note: Unfortunately, there is no save functionality yet, and there aren't as many outfits as I would have liked – I'll try to add more in the future! Further, the website does not support mobile or smaller window sizes, however, this is something that I am in the process of creating, and hopefully it will be supported soon!
